# Introduction

Bootstrap your Symfony 6 projects efficiently with this structured base layout. 
Featuring the latest Symfony version, essential configurations, and standardized architecture, 
it's your starting point for scalable and robust applications.

## Installation

##### Install composer dependencies

```shell
composer install
```

##### Install node dependencies and build project

```shell
yarn install # or npm install
yarn build # or yarn dev or yarn watch
```

##### Start Symfony project

```shell
symfony serve # you can use '-d' flag for starting in the background
```

## Code Style

The project has built-in tools for analyzing and fixing code, such as:

- **ESLint** (TypeScript)
- **Prettier** (TypeScript)
- **PHPInsights** (Symfony)

You can find example commands below. 
Additionally, you don't have to manually run each command as Husky and Lint-Staged have been 
installed in the project, which will automatically trigger checks before creating a git commit.

### Symfony

```shell
composer code:validation # check code with PHPInsights
composer code:fix # same as previous, but with automatic fix
```

### TypeScript

```shell
# Install Husky events
yarn prepare # or npx prepare

# ESLint
yarn lint # or npx lint
yarn format # or npx format

# Prettier
yarn pretty # or npx pretty
```
